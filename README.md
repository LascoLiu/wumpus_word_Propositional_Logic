This project involves the implementation of a logical agent for navigating a modified Wumpus World environment using Propositional Logic. The goal is to describe the state of knowledge and reasoning of the agent throughout its journey in the Wumpus World environment.

Part I: Setting Up the Knowledgebase
To describe the Wumpus World environment and set up the knowledgebase:


Follow the instructions in the notebook to add symbols and sentences to the PropKB knowledgebase.

Part II: Logical Inferences and Agent's First Move
Demonstrate how to infer useful knowledge from the knowledgebase and select the first move for the agent using logical reasoning.

Part III: Agent's Journey and Updating Knowledge
Explain how to update the knowledgebase with percepts received in new squares and how the inferred knowledge helps the agent decide the next move.

Part IV: Agent's Situation at Square (1,2)
Describe the agent's situation at square (1,2) after visiting (2,1). Explain the logical reasoning behind the situation and how the inferred knowledge influences the next move.
